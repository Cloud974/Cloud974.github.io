title: Complicated Minimalism
---

Simple is sophisticated. In every facet of life, the designs we regularly interact with have become less cluttered, more streamlined, and (mostly) easier to use. My smartphone has 4 physical buttons and a screen that takes up almost all of its front- and yet I can do far more with it than the old Nokia brick I first had. Behind this seeming contradiction is one ineffable reality- a ton of work has gone into maximizing what you do with a minimal design.

In the two projects I have worked on so far, this complicated minimalism has sent me looking for prime examples of design that gets out of its own way, and I would like to share some examples with you.

The first site is [iFly50](https://www.ifly50.com/en_us)- a sort of interactive travel brochure brought to you courtesy of Royal Dutch Airlines. On this site you can view 50 travel locations to pique your adventurous spirit. To that end- the focus on each item is the location itself. Each location is boiled down to an incredible photograph that isn't sequestered to a small window- but given the entire background so that a user can be immersed. Add to that photographic immersion the fact that there are 6 minimal buttons taking an absolute minimum of space makes this site an experience.

A more traditional website can still provide examples of simple sophistication. [Ideo's](https://www.ideo.com/) website is a strong example of a clean and simple layout. One of the first things you will notice is the prevalence of white spacing and clear black text. Hovering over any clickable text will produce a classic yellow highlight as well. The font is large and also of a lighter weight- which combined with an elegant serif style gives a serious tone while being sleek and legible. The clarity of these simple elements makes for a much more pleasant interaction.

Lastly, [Tommy Parker](tommyparker.co.uk) has a wonderful portfolio. Considering that a portfolio should showcase his work- this page design works to just that end. landing page spares only a small amount of space at the top for a navbar while giving full attention to his sample work. Hovering over the images provides additional information and clicking each picture takes you to a more extensive view of that project. There is no prompting to click on the pictures, nor an extensive sidebar to use for navigation. The design prompts this on its own, which allows for a more direct interaction with the focus- the artwork in portfolio.

Simplicity can be achieved in a number of ways. From decluttered layouts, intuitive animations, and even a strong focus on a site's purpose. It is doubtless that the design an implementation in each of these sites was complex- but because there isn't clutter and because the elements work to achieve a specific end- the result is a website worth remembering.
