I wrote about it briefly before but this site has been on my mind non-stop recently, and so I felt I needed to come back and go further in depth. This is one of the best thought-out design I have come across and it all starts with how it loads.

In this short loading screen, there are a couple of wonderful things happening all at once. For starters, the count is going up to 50, which is more appropriate for this website than a generic 100% would be. Beyond that, the site begins with a very blank slate of white. There is a minimum of branding, with only a small persistent KLM logo in the lower left. And the only thing occupying the middle third of the view is a cue letting you know there is sound that goes with this visual.

Once the loading is completed- it then begins the transition it will use all throughout the 50 locations.

With each transition, there is also a number of elements happening in short order!

Notice how the interfaces all fade out, followed quickly by the image that has occupied the full screen. This happens quickly but sets up the user to understand we are moving to the next "slide". The next location's number is then slid upwards composed of the next image with the background fading in the next image slightly obscured. Then the obscured layer is slid upwards, followed by the interface. This is a complicated string of events, for a transition that lasts about a second, but it makes each transition feel smooth and alive.

Plus, look at how gorgeous these pictures are!

This same transitioning happens when you open up the full gallery via the upper left icon.

While diving through the list, some of the backgrounds are actually gifs or videos too. Coming across these outliers, enlivens the experience, and makes the journey of moving through these 50 locations feel like a bit of an adventure.

Some location also offer additional information- either alternate pictures or - as in the case with no. 47- New Zealand "a galaxy of glittering glow worms"- videos that go into further depth.

I feel like all of the thought and care and consistency in design has placed this easily as one my top sites. If you haven't already, please take a look over at [ifly50.com](https://www.ifly50.com/en_us).
