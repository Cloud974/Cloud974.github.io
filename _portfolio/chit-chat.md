short-description: Bloc Chat is a chat application utilizing AngularJS and Firebase.

Chit-Chat represents the second product- the first of which allows me freedom of design choices. Utilizing the AngularJS framework and the back-end support of Firebase, the real-time chat application marks my first adventure in interacting with a backend!

With the freedom I had in this project also came some significant obstacles:

-Deciding on a cohesive design.

-Implementation of css (and subsequent alterations) of said design.

-Implementation of approved data structures (Firebase requires flat structuring)

-Coupling of backend data and frontend utility

Through some mentor guidance, I was introduced to a number of great design references- dribbble, and css-tricks.com. These sites helped build my repertoire of design ideas and implementations.

Lastly, I have refactored the site to utilize the clean css that bootstrap offers- leading me to the finished product you see.
