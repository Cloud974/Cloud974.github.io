short-description: BlocJams is a digital music player like Spotify.

---
The first project in my web developer track through bloc was coding a digital music player mirroring the basic structure of Spotify. For this frontend build, I initially constructed the site with html/css and javascript. Through iterations designed to improve code coherence and performance- jQuery and Angular were later brought in. Functionality also relies upon Buzz! a library designed around HTML5 Audio.

BlocJams currently is composed of three different sections- a landing page, a collection view, and an album view with a player bar.

Through iterative design- I have come to see the ways in which the different parts are of value. If not for all the DOM manipulation I may not have appreciated the ease that a structured M-V-Whatever approach that the Angular framework supports naturally.
